# PySpark-2-Day-Bootcamp-Workshop

I have compiled a curriculum for absolute Spark beginner, that could be completed over two days. I am following Top-Down approach for learning, i.e. trying to get into the Breadth of the system first, then in Depth, along with grate Hands-On practicals and supporting theory.
